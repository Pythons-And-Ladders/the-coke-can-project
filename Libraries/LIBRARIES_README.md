# Libraries

This folder contains the libraries used within the project at its current state.

## Contents:

- `aioble`: Provides Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support for asynchronous communication, enabling BLE connections, advertising, and data exchange in non-blocking tasks.
- `micropyGPS`: Processes NMEA data from the GNSS module, allowing for easy parsing and interpretation of location, speed, and time data.
- `network`: Manages network interfaces such as WiFi, enabling setup for both access point (AP) and station (STA) modes and handling network connections.

## Disclaimer:

In addition to the libraries listed above, the code utilises pre-installed libraries like `machine`, `time`, and `bluetooth`. A full list of available libraries with Micropython can be found on the [Micropython website](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/index.html).
